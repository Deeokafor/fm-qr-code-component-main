## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Css utility-first framework


### What I learned

When I started on building this project, I took the route of using custom CSS and building 'tailwindcss-style' classes. Halfway through the project, I realised there was no need to reinvent the wheel. I dropped custom CSS although I had developed an approach and methodology while writing my 'tailwindcss-styled' classes which I have currently exported to a separate stylesheet for future development (maybe). I realised that I was getting myself into a hassle and had to retrace my steps.


I am deeply thankful to the developers and maintainers of frameworks and libraries used in web development.




### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me with quickly looking up tailwind classes for styling components. It has a helpful search engine by ```Algolia```

- [Google's Search Page](https://google.com) - ```of course it is google.com```.
